  ## Description
  This project showcased the use of Models and different Routes to create a backend for an Ecommerece Website.

  ## Installation Instructions
  'npm install' all dependencies, 'npm run seed' to seed data, 'node server.js' to spin up the server.

  ## How to Use This Application
  This project will allow the website that uses it to keep a tab on their inventory, update stock levels, and will allow the company to keep their products organized. There are many use-cases as the code allows for adding products and categories, as well as deleting & updating those products and categories. The code allows for quick searching for products as well, so if a customer wanted to know if a certain product was in stock, the user only needs to search by the product's ID and it will show the user how many are in stock.
